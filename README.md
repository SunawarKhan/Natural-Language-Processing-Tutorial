NLP Tutorial
Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Whether you're a beginner venturing into the world of NLP or an experienced practitioner seeking to broaden your skill set, this tutorial is designed to cater to your needs.

Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. From sentiment analysis to machine translation, NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. This tutorial aims to demystify NLP concepts and equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle real-world text data challenges.

Prerequisites
To make the most of this tutorial, a basic understanding of Python programming is recommended. Familiarity with fundamental machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, classification, and feature engineering will also be beneficial. While prior experience with NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch is advantageous, it's not mandatory as we'll cover these tools from the ground up.

Tutorial Content
The tutorial is structured into ten comprehensive modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of NLP:

Introduction to NLP: Gain an understanding of NLP fundamentals and its applications.
Text Preprocessing: Learn techniques to clean and preprocess text data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Explore methods to convert raw text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
Sentiment Analysis: Dive into sentiment analysis techniques to infer the sentiment of text data.
Text Classification: Understand how to classify text documents into predefined categories or labels.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Learn how to identify and classify named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in text data.
Word Embeddings: Explore word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec and GloVe to represent words as dense vectors.
Sequence-to-Sequence Models: Discover sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation and text summarization.
Attention Mechanisms: Understand attention mechanisms and their role in improving sequence modeling tasks.
Advanced NLP Techniques: Delve into advanced topics such as transfer learning, language modeling, and transformer architectures.
Each module comprises theoretical explanations, practical code examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding and skills.
